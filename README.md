# masterMind_python
We will implement a simple version of the Mastermind game, and using an iterative programming approach we will enhance it in future problems.  Iteration 1: Create a simple implementation of Mastermind using what you know about data structures, loops and conditional statements.  Iteration 2: Use functions to improve the code.  Iteration 3: Improve the use of functions and return values, as well as applying testing techniques.
